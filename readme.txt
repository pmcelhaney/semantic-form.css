semantic-form.css

This is a variation of the stylesheet I've been been using to style forms for
a while. It allows me to quickly build a form with terse, semantic markup and
have it come out looking decent. It's not perfect, but it's a good start. I
welcome suggestions.

See how it works in the example index.html page.
